# Player Dash Controls
Working version available at [https://godot-dash.netlify.app/](https://godot-dash.netlify.app/)

A quick player dash test in Godot, use the arrow keys to move.

The goal with this project was to create a fun feeling dash effect.

If you're interested in playing around with this project download it and import it into Godot. The project is very simple and barebones so it shouldn't be hard to understand what I made.
